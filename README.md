# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Project README

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification using Python and popular data science libraries. KNN is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. In this project, we focus on the classification aspect and use KNN to classify data points into two classes based on their features. The dataset used for this project is referred to as "KNN_Project_Data."

## Prerequisites

Before running the code in this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Required Python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Project Structure

- `KNN_Project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanations for the KNN classification analysis.
- `KNN_Project_Data`: CSV file containing the dataset used for analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`KNN_Project.ipynb`) using your preferred Python IDE or Jupyter Notebook itself.
3. Ensure you have the dataset file named `KNN_Project_Data` in the same directory as the notebook.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run each cell step by step to follow the KNN classification analysis process.
2. The notebook contains detailed comments and explanations for each code cell to help you understand the workflow.

## Exploring the Data

We start by exploring the dataset to gain insights into its structure and contents:

- Loading the dataset using Pandas.
- Displaying basic statistics and information about the data.
- Plotting pair plots to visualize the relationships between variables and their distributions.

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model

The main part of the project involves building and training a KNN classification model:

- Importing and applying feature scaling using `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn to standardize the feature values.
- Preparing the data by selecting relevant features (`X`) and the target variable (`y`).
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn.
- Creating a KNN classifier using `KNeighborsClassifier` from scikit-learn.
- Fitting the model to the training data.
- Making predictions using the test data.

## Model Evaluation

We evaluate the performance of the KNN classification model using key metrics:

- Generating a confusion matrix to visualize true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
- Creating a classification report to display precision, recall, F1-score, and support.

## Choosing the Optimal K-Value

We determine the optimal value of K (number of neighbors) by analyzing the error rate for different values of K:

- Calculating the error rate for K values ranging from 1 to 39.
- Plotting the error rate vs. K value to identify the optimal K.

## Retraining with the Optimal K-Value

Finally, we retrain the KNN classifier using the optimal K value and evaluate its performance:

- Creating a new KNN classifier with the optimal K value.
- Fitting the model to the training data.
- Making predictions and evaluating the model with the new K value.
